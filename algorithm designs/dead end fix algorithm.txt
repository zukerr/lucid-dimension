Solution 1.

Check whether or not there is a soft lock:

-Iterate through every existing room
-On every iteration check if the room has a door and there is no connected room to it
	-if yes, then break the loop and return false[There is no dead end]
-If the loop ended and we havent found such room, then generated map is soft locked [return true]

--> summary: complexity O(n) worst case (where n is a number of rooms)
