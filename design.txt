Room design

Room types:

1. Common mobs
	reward: 1 random card
2. Elite mobs
	reward: few(3?) cards
3. Boss
	reward: pack(10-20) cards

Room ideas:

Common:
	"Imps":
		There are 4 casting mobs around the room with relatively long cast time
		and low health. They start casting a high hitting instant damage spell on room activation.
		Additionaly there are 2 melee mobs with high health going after the player.
		The player has to kite the mobs and attack the casters to survive.
		Focusing on melees b4 casters most likely results in death.
		Terrain: one pillar in the center.
	"Wild dogs":
		Very easy starting room, just few fast melee mobs with low health dealing low damage.
		Terrain: few rocks, open space
		
	

Overall gameplay

-first 9 rooms are always common mobs
-10th room is deckbuilding room
-after 10th room there is a chance of getting elite room(there are 8-12 elite rooms for each 50 rooms(b4 each boss))
-boss room spawns every ~50 rooms(probably rng between 40-60)
-every 10-12 rooms there is a deckbuilding room
